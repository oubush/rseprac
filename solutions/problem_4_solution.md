# Problem 4:
You have been approached by a Social Sciences researcher who wishes to collect some data from
Twitter and Facebook to follow the comments posted by a particular group of individuals in the run-
up to the 2019 Indian general election.
How would you go about the process of Requirements Analysis for this query? What are the most
important questions you should ask, and why?

# Answer to the problem 4
The goal of requirements analysis is to gather essential information to ensure the success and feasibility of the project. Here are some important questions I would ask during the process of Requirements Analysis:

1. What is the research objective? This question helps understand the researcher's specific goal and the insights they aim to gain. 

2. Who are the target individuals or group? Understanding the target group's characteristics, such as political affiliations, geographic location, or demographic information, helps define the criteria for data collection. It ensures that the collected data focuses on the specific group of interest.

3. What data needs to be collected? This information will help understand the specific data elements to capture, such as comments, likes, shares, timestamps, user profiles, or any other relevant metadata.

4. How large is the target data set? This information will help determine the expected volume of data to be collected and assess the feasibility of data storage, processing and analysis. It will also help determine the appropriate sampling techniques or data filtering strategies if the data set is too large to handle entirely.

5. Are there any legal or ethical considerations? Any legal restrictions, data usage policies or ethical guidelines that need to be followed during the data collection process may affect data collection and storage strategy. It also may require compliance with privacy regulations and obtaining necessary permissions or approvals.

6. What is the desired timeframe for data collection? This information helps determine the specific time period for data collection.

7. How will the data be analysed? Understanding the analysis methods and techniques the researcher plans to employ ensures that the collected data is in a suitable format for analysis, and that the necessary data preprocessing steps are taken.

8. What platforms will be included? This information will help determine if the data collection will focus solely on Twitter and Facebook or include other social media platforms as well. This will help identify the data sources that need to be accessed and the necessary APIs or tools required for data extraction.

9. What resources are available? Understanding the available resources such as budget, time, expertise and infrastructure hepls identify any potential constraints or limitations.

By addressing these important questions during the process of Requirements Analysis, we can define the project scope and establish a solid foundation for the data collection.
